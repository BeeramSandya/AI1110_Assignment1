\section{ICSE 10 2018 Paper Question 1(c)}
 Cards bearing numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 are kept in a bag. A card is drawn at random from the bag. Find the probability of getting a card which is:\\ 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item a prime number.
\item a number divisible by 4.
\item a number that is a multiple of 6.
\item an odd number.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Answer}
 Probability, by definition is the ratio of number of favourable outcomes to total number of possible outcomes.\\
 \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item As given numbers are all even numbers from 2 to 20, only 2 is the prime number. And number of possible outcomes is 10.\\
So required probability of getting a card bearing a prime number is \( \frac{1}{10} \).\\
\item Among the given numbers 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 are divisible by 4. The total number of cards are 10 out of which 5 cards are divisible by 4.\\
Required probability is \( \frac{5}{10} \) = \( \frac{1}{2} \).
\\Therefore, probability of getting a card bearing a number that is divisible by 4 is \(\frac{1}{2} \).\\
\item Among the given numbers 6, 12 and 18 are multiples of 6.The total number of outcomes are 10 out of which 3 are required cards.\\
So, required probability of getting a card bearing a number that is multiple of 6 is \(\frac{3}{10}\).\\
\item There are no odd numbers present among the given set of numbers.\\
Therefore, the probability of getting a card bearing an odd number is  0.\\
\end{enumerate}
